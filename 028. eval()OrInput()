Task

You are given a polynomial P of a single indeterminate (or variable), x.
You are also given the values of x and k. Your task is to verify if P(x)=k.

Constraints
All coefficients of polynomial P are integers.
x and y are also integers.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated values of x and k.
The second line contains the polynomial P.

Output Format

Print True if P(x) =k. Otherwise, print False.

Sample Input

1 4
x**3 + x**2 + x + 1
Sample Output

True
Explanation

p(1)=1^3+1^2+1+1 = 4 =k
Hence, the output is True.

solution
: 
x,k=map(int, input().split())
print (k==eval(input()))




1 4
x**3 + x**2 + x + 1
x = 1 and k = 4 are extracted from the first line of input.
The second line of input is x**3 + x**2 + x + 1, which is passed to eval().
The eval() function computes the result of x**3 + x**2 + x + 1 where x = 1. This evaluates to 1**3 + 1**2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
The comparison k == eval(input()) becomes 4 == 4, which is True.

Why eval() Is Used:
The eval() function is a way to dynamically evaluate expressions. It's useful in cases like this, where the mathematical
expression may vary, and you want to evaluate it as Python code.
Warning: In general, be cautious when using eval(), especially with user input, because it can execute arbitrary code. 
However, in controlled scenarios (like this one), it's fine.
