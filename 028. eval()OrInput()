Task

You are given a polynomial P of a single indeterminate (or variable), x.
You are also given the values of x and k. Your task is to verify if P(x)=k.

Constraints
All coefficients of polynomial P are integers.
x and y are also integers.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated values of x and k.
The second line contains the polynomial P.

Output Format

Print True if P(x) =k. Otherwise, print False.

Sample Input

1 4
x**3 + x**2 + x + 1
Sample Output

True
Explanation

p(1)=1^3+1^2+1+1 = 4 =k
Hence, the output is True.

solution
: 
x,k=map(int, input().split())
print (k==eval(input()))



x = 2
print eval ('x+1')
Output of this code = 3

So , eval('expression') is used to evaluate an expression . It is used to find the value of the expression , given the values of all the variables involved in that expression.

input() and eval() perform the same task of evaluating an expression.

input() is equivalent to eval(raw_input()) . Let us see how :

For the given question the code using input() is as follows:

x,k = map ( int , raw_input().split())
print input() == k
And the code using eval( raw_input() ) is as follows:

x,k = map ( int , raw_input().split())
print eval(raw_input()) == k
The code using eval() is as follows :

x,k = map ( int , raw_input().split())
s= raw_input()
print eval(s) == k
