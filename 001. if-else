"""
Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 , print Weird
If  is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints
1<=n>=100

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

"""
n = int(input().strip()) #strip will remove the whitespaces
if(n%2==0):
    if(n>=2 and n<=5):
        print("Not Weird")
    elif(n>=6 and n<=20):
        print("Weird")
    elif (n>20):
         print("Not Weird")
else: print("Weird ")

(or)


n = int(input().strip())
check = {True: "Not Weird", False: "Weird"}

print(check[n%2==0 and (n in range(2,6) or n > 20) ])

defined a simple dictionary. 
If the value it gets is true, 
the program prints "Not Weird", and if it's false "Weird" is printed.
Then I simply created a bunch of statements that evaluate to either True or False.

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
#print(n%2) would print 1 if its true. 
if (n%2) or (6 <= n <= 20):
    print('Weird')
else:
    print('Not Weird')
