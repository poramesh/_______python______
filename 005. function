An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar 
for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

A year is considered a leap year if it satisfies the following conditions:
Divisible by 4: The year must be evenly divisible by 4.
Not Divisible by 100: If the year is divisible by 100, then it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years

Examples:
2000: This year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400, so it is a leap year.
1900: This year is divisible by 4 and 100 but not by 400, so it is not a leap year.
2020: This year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, so it is a leap year.
2021: This year is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.


Sample Input 
1990
Sample Output 
False
Explanation 
1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap yea



def is_leap(year):
    leap = False

    if year % 4 == 0:
       if year % 100 != 0:
           leap = True
       elif year % 400 == 0:
           leap = True
    return leap
    
 (or)
 
    #return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0)
