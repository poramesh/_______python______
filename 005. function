An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar 
for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

A year is considered a leap year if it satisfies the following conditions:
Divisible by 4: The year must be evenly divisible by 4.
Not Divisible by 100: If the year is divisible by 100, then it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years

Examples:
2000: This year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400, so it is a leap year.
1900: This year is divisible by 4 and 100 but not by 400, so it is not a leap year.
2020: This year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, so it is a leap year.
2021: This year is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.


Earth's Orbital Period: The Earth takes approximately 365.2425 days to orbit the Sun. To keep our calendar in sync with this, we need 
to account for the extra 0.2425 days each year.

Adding a Day Every 4 Years: By adding an extra day every 4 years (leap year), we add approximately 0.25 days per year, which is
close to the extra 0.2425 days. However, this slightly overcompensates.

Skipping Leap Year Every 100 Years: To correct the overcompensation, we skip a leap year every 100 years. This means 
that years divisible by 100 are not leap years. This adjustment removes 0.01 days per year,
balancing the previous overcompensation.

Reinserting Leap Year Every 400 Years: Skipping a leap year every 100 years slightly undercompensates
(0.2425 - 0.24 = 0.0025 days per year). To correct this, we reinstate the leap year for
years divisible by 400. This fine-tunes the correction further.

Sample Input 
1990
Sample Output 
False
Explanation 
1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap yea
