XPath Axes Examples

Let's apply various XPath axes to this HTML structure.

1. ancestor
Select all ancestors of the element with ID important (i.e., the paragraph with class important).
XPath: //p[@class='important']/ancestor::*
Explanation: This selects all ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.) of the paragraph element with class important.
Result: It will select the section and div elements (and possibly others, depending on the hierarchy).


2. ancestor-or-self
Select all ancestors of the element with class important, as well as the element itself.
XPath: //p[@class='important']/ancestor-or-self::*
Explanation: This selects the element with class important itself and all of its ancestors.
Result: It will select the p element with class important and its section ancestor.


3. attribute
Select all attributes of the section element with ID section1.
XPath: //section[@id='section1']/@*
Explanation: This selects all attributes of the section element with the id of section1.
Result: It will select the id="section1" attribute.


4. child
Select all children of the section with ID section2.
XPath: //sectioncid='section2']/child::*
Explanation: This selects all child elements within the section element with id="section2".
Result: It will select the h2, p, and div elements inside section2.


5. descendant
Select all descendants of the div element with ID container.
XPath: //div[@id='container']/descendant::*
Explanation: This selects all descendant elements (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the div with id="container".
Result: It will select every element inside the div#container, including section, p, div, h2, etc.


6. descendant-or-self
Select all descendants of the section with ID section2, as well as the section itself.
XPath://section[@id='section2']/descendant-or-self::*
Explanation: This selects the section with id="section2" and all of its descendants.
Result: It will select the section#section2, h2, p, and div elements inside it.


7. following
Select all elements that come after the h2 inside section2.
XPath: //section[@id='section2']//h2/following::*
Explanation: This selects all elements that appear after the h2 element inside section2.
Result: It will select the p and div elements that follow the h2 inside section2.(nested elements as well
whereas following sibling strictly gets only yhe sibling and not their childrens )


8. following-sibling
Select all siblings that come after the h2 in section1.
XPath: //section[@id='section1']//h2/following-sibling::*
Explanation: This selects all siblings that follow the h2 element within section1.
Result: It will select the p and p elements that are siblings to the h2 inside section1.

9. namespace
Select all namespace nodes (if any).
XPath: //@*
Explanation: This selects all attributes in the document, which could include namespace attributes (though this HTML does not have namespaces).


10. parent
Select the parent of the p element inside section1.
XPath:
//section[@id='section1']//p/parent::*
Explanation: This selects the parent of the p element inside section1, which is the section element.
Result: It will select the section with id="section1".

11. preceding
Select all elements that come before the p element inside section1.
XPath: //section[@id='section1']//p/preceding::*
Explanation: This selects all elements that come before the p element inside section1.
Result: It will select the h2 element, which comes before the p element in section1.


12. preceding-sibling
Select all siblings that come before the div with id="footer".
XPath: //div[@id='footer']/preceding-sibling::*
Explanation: This selects all sibling elements before the div#footer.
Result: It will select the section elements that come before the footer.

13. self
Select the section element with id="section1" itself.
XPath: //section[@id='section1']/self::*
Explanation: This selects the section element with id="section1" itself.
Result: It will select the section#section1 element.
