s = ""
for i in range(1,n+1):
    s += str(i)

(or)
for i in range(1,n+1): 
    print(i,end='')
#In python cursor will go to next line automatically so using end=" " we can stop the cursor

result = ''.join(str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))

print(*range(1, int(input())+1), sep='')

For short operator '*' allows you to pass an array. Example:

user = [name, password, captcha]

log_in(*user)

The * is actually used to unpack a iterator. *[1,2,3] mean 1 2 3
