Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. 
You are given n scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

Input Format

The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.

Constraint

2<=n <=10
-100<=A[i]<=100

Ouput Format
print the runner-up score.

Sample Input 
5
2 3 6 6 5
Sample Output 
5
Explanation 
Given list is [2,3,4,6,6,5]. The maximum score is 6 , second maximum is 5. Hence, we print  as the runner-up score.

Solution: 

n = int(input())
arr = list(set(map(int, input().split())))
arr.sort()
print(arr[-2]) //negative indices are used to access elements from the end of a list (or array)

(or)

i = int(input())
lis = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
z = max(lis)
while max(lis) == z:
    lis.remove(max(lis))
print(max(lis))



lis = [1, 2, 3, 3]
lis.remove(3) # Remove the first occurrence of 3
print lis #[1, 2, 3]


numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]
max_value = max(numbers) # Find the maximum value


(or)

print(sorted(list(set(arr)))[-2])

(or)

 n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max([x for x in arr if x!=max(arr)])) # excluding max in the list comphrenstion and then getting the maax from the list that doesn contains first max
    
(or)

n = int(input())
a = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
#print(a) #[6, 6, 5, 3, 2]
#print(a.count(a[0])) #2, isnt this brilliant?
print(a[a.count(a[0])])
