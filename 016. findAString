Task: 


in this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string. 
String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.

NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive.

Input Format

The first line of input contains the original string. The next line contains the substring.

Constraint: 
1<=len(string) <=200
Each character in the string is an ascii character.

Output Format

Output the integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.

Sample Input

ABCDCDC
CDC
Sample Output
2


what is substring?? A substring is a sequence of characters that appears within another string. It can be as short as a single character or as long as the entire string itself.

For the string "Hello, World":

"Hello", "World", ", W", and "o" are all substrings.
"Hi" is not a substring because it does not appear in the string.

Contiguous: Substrings are always contiguous sequences of characters. For example, in "apple", "apl" is not a substring since it skips characters.

In Python:
text = "Hello, World"
print(text[0:5])  # Outputs "Hello"

In JavaScript:
let text = "Hello, World";
console.log(text.substring(0, 5));  // Outputs "Hello"

Solution:

def count_substring(string, subString):
    count =0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if subString in string[i:i+len(subString)]:
            #print(string[i:i+len(subString)])
            count = count+1
    return count

(or)

def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i:].startswith(sub_string):
            count += 1
    return count

(or)

return sum([ 1 for i in range(len(string)-len(substring)+1) if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring])

#After iterating over all indices, the list comprehension contains [1, 1] and it will be summed up and returned

        



if __name__ == '__main__':
    string = input().strip()
    sub_string = input().strip()
    
    count = count_substring(string, sub_string)
    print(count)
