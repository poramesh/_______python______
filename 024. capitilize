You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be 
capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

Input Format

A single line of input containing the full name, S.

Constraints
> 0<len(S)<1000
>The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

Output Format

Print the capitalized string,S .

Sample Input
chris alan

Sample Output
Chris Alan

Solution:

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the solve function below.

def solve(s):
    
    for x in s.split(" "):
        s = s.replace(x,x.capitalize()) 
    return s #hello world to Hello World


#The code above is a bit inefficient as replace() method inside the loop creates copies of string. The reason is that a string is an immutable object. 
So it's better first to translate it into a mutable object,
process the mutable one inside the loop and finally make a backward transformation.
so use this one?instead.

a_string = input().split(' ')
print(' '.join((word.capitalize() for word in a_string)))
----
if i dont  use this is what it happesn split

import string
# Complete the solve function below.
def solve(s):
    print(s) # hello world
    return ' '.join(x.capitalize() for x in s) #H E L L O   W O R L D
------

(or)
    return s.title() but this would fail in one test case. 123abc will be capitalised when it shouldnt be.
(or)

' '.join(map(str.capitalize, string.split(' ')))

(or)
def solve(s):
    return string.capwords(s," ")

        

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')
    s = input()
    result = solve(s)
    fptr.write(result + '\n')
    fptr.close()
(or)

 s = ' '.join(map(str.capitalize, string.split(' '))) # if we dont s = then it wont be replaced cause string is immutable
 return s


""""
print(input().title()) will not work because the question is asking to capitalise firse letter of each word keeping in mind that "if it is a letter". Title 
and Capitalise are different in function as:

'abcd'.title()
results in 'Abcd' but

'12abcd'.title()
results in '12Abcd'. This is not what we want.
